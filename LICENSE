This is a modified version of Blu's License of Common Sense
====================================

Here's how it goes: I like making my code visible so that others may learn from it. Reason for that is because I myself learned a lot that way.
What I don't like is anyone's creative property being stolen, used without credit or commercialized without permission.

As such, this is my custom license which should hopefully cover all that:

#### Definitions of Terms:
- "You": refers to anyone who is not the license holder

#### Disclaimer:
- While I have done my best to cover all use cases of this project, if there is a situation wherein permissions are not covered by this license, assume you do not have those permissions. If you believe you should have those permissions, contact me.

#### What you *can* do:
- Look at the code, draw inspiration, copy bits of it to use in your own projects
- Fork this repository and modify its code
- Submit Pull Requests to this repository
- Write other projects that base on this project and its API (if present) (This means Addons are totally cool)
- Include this mod in minecraft modpacks
- Monetize video's, streams or other content created from playing minecraft with this mod installed.

#### What you *can not* do:
- Claim any of this code to be your property
- Redistribute this project (source or compiled) without explicit permission of the license holder
- Copy large sections of this code (classes, complex methods) without giving credit
- Monetize any part of this project in a way which requires a direct or indirect transfer of money to gain access the project. This means selling the code, compiled projects and also forbids the use of paywalls or "donations" to restrict access to any part of the project's content.

#### What you *have to* abide by:
- If you have used any code from this project (with the exception of API classes), that project must also be visible source. This allows others to learn from your work.
- Give proper credit where it's due when copying portions of the code (see above)

#### On the topic of *resources*:
- Always give credit to original artists/creators
- Always ask for permission before copying assets
- Addon mods are allowed to use and remix art & model assets for the sole purpose of being addons. When in doubt, better ask.

#### Abandonment:
- This project will be considered abandoned if; the project has not received an update in over 365 days, there is no intents of further updates and the license holder is "unable to be contacted" (for the license holder be considered "unable to be contacted", all means of communication listed in the "Means of Contact" section of this document must have successfully been attempted and have had absolutely no response in over 365 days.)
- This project may also be explicitly labeled as abandoned by the license holder. This can be done by marking this repository as archived, or creating a pinned issue stating that the mod has been abandoned.
- Should this project be "abandoned" as outlined above, then all permissions withheld by this license shall be given to everyone.

#### In summary:
Please, look at the code and learn from it (where possible). Draw inspiration, be creative, enjoy yourself. Should you find issues, point them out. Have an idea how to fix it? Submit a PR.
Stealing code or assets isn't cool though. Don't do that.
